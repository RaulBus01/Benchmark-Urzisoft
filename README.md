# RAM and CPU Benchmark

This benchmark measures the performance of RAM and CPU using single-core and multi-core algorithms. It provides insights into the speed and efficiency of these components under different workloads.

## Minimum Requirements

- 2GB RAM
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run the Jar file

## Features

1. RAM Benchmark: Tests the read and write performance of the RAM.
2. CPU Benchmark (Single-core): Measures the processing speed of a single CPU core.
3. CPU Benchmark (Multi-core): Evaluates the parallel processing capabilities of multiple CPU cores.
4. Leaderboard: Saves the benchmark scores in a leaderboard for future reference.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
2. Download the benchmark Jar file.
3. Run the Jar file using the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   java -jar benchmark.jar
   ```

4. The benchmark will execute different tests and provide the results.

## Scoring

The benchmark assigns scores to measure the performance of RAM and CPU. The scores are calculated based on the execution time and the specific benchmark algorithm. Lower scores indicate better performance.

## Leaderboard

The leaderboard feature allows you to save benchmark scores for future reference and comparison. The scores are stored in a file or database, and you can view the leaderboard to see the performance rankings of different systems.

## Contributing

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the benchmark's GitHub repository.

## Disclaimer

This benchmark provides performance measurements based on specific algorithms and workloads. The results may vary depending on the system configuration, hardware, and software environment. Use these results as a reference and consider running the benchmark on your specific system to evaluate its performance accurately.
